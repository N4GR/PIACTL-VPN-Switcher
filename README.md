# PIACTL VPN Switcher
PIA offers the ability for their launcher to be ran without the use of a UI, whether through calling arguments in the .exe or a linux package - this is the ideal way that I use PIA for my everyday needs. I required a way to automatically switch the region of the VPN at certain or random intervals for a specific online service I was using, this script is just a way to do that.
